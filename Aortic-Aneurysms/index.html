      <h1>Aortic Aneurysms</h1>
      <p>Aortic aneurysms are something that affects the main artery and its wall, weakening it, allowing it to widen or “balloon out.” Then the artery could burst, making it a medical emergency. And this is caused by the hardening of the arteries. It could also cause the blood flow to not flow to organs and tissue, heart attacks, kidney damage, stroke, and even death. But in less serious cases it might make you feel numbness, weakness, tingling, pallor, or coldness in an arm or leg, loss of sensation, lightheadedness, or localized pain</p>
      <p>Two of the most common symptoms of having aortic aneurysms is chest or back pain with that being the first sign of having this disease. Other symptoms may include increased sweating, a fast heart rate, rapid breathing, dizziness, a feeling of fullness after eating minimal food, nausea, vomiting, a strong pulse in the abdomen and shock.</p>
      <p>There are some things that can lead to aortic aneurysms like high blood pressure, diabetes, cystic medial necrosis, mycotic aneurysm, inflammatory aneurysm, and injury to the chest or abdomen. And with leads, there are risks that can lead to you having this disease with that being  55 or older, male sex, smoking, family history of aortic aneurysms, and hardening of the arteries.</p>
      <p>But do not worry this disease can be treated even if it is risky. Treatment all depends on the person's overall health, the location of the aneurysms, and if the person is having symptoms. If the aneurysms is too big treating it becomes riskier then having it. Some complications of untreatable aortic aneurysms are blood clot, internal bleeding, and circulatory shock.</p>
      <p>But again do not worry because there are no ways to prevent aneurysms but there are ways to keep blood vessels healthy and strong. Some things you can do are have a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, being active for a least 30 minutes a day, don't smoke, and control your blood pressure. </p>
